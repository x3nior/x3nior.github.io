  <h1>What are quest in Bloxfruits?</h1>
  <p>In Blox Fruits, quests are tasks given by NPCs that players can complete to earn experience points (XP), money (Belly or Beli or Cash), and sometimes special rewards. There are different types of quests, generally categorized by levels and locations, corresponding to the game’s various islands. Here’s a breakdown of the quest types:

Starter Quests: These are available in the beginning and help players learn the game mechanics.

Level Quests: Each island typically has quests designed for specific player levels. Completing these helps you level up and unlock new abilities.

Boss Quests: These involve defeating powerful NPC bosses. They often provide better rewards.

Delivery Quests: Players may be tasked with delivering items to different locations or NPCs.

Bounty Quests: Some quests involve hunting down players with bounties, especially in PvP scenarios.

Completing quests is essential for progressing in the game, as they help increase your character's strength and unlock new features. Are there specific quests or islands you're curious about?</p>
